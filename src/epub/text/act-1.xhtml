									<span>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that “Caesar”?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But it was famed with more than with one man?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When could they say till now, that talk’d of Rome,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When there is in it but one only man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As easily as a king.</span>
