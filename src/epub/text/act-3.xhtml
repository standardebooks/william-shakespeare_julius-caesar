									<span>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Quite vanquish’d him: then burst his mighty heart;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</span>

									<br/>
