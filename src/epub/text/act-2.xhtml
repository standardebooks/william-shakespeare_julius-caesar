									<br/>
									<span>How that might change his nature, there’s the question.</span>

									<span>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I have not known when his affections sway’d</span>

									<span>More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>But when he once attains the upmost round,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</span>

									<span>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.</span>

									<span>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will bear no colour for the thing he is,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would run to these and these extremities:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg</span>

									<span>Which, hatch’d, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,</span>
